## All New Site!
Welcome to the soft launch of the new ARK Modding website. We have completely
redesigned and built the site from the ground up using 
[Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/). We have also integrated this site
with GitHub pages! Members of the community are invited to contribute to our 
site and help share their knowledge with others. To contribute, follow the 
guides under the [Contributing](/category/contributing) category.

We would also like to invite new members to the community through our 
[Discord](https://dicsord.arkmodding.net). For the safety of the community,
we do require game ownership verification, but this is a one-time process
to join.

We look forward to working with you and seeing what crazy chaos comes of it.
