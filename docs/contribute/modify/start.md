# Starting Docusaurus

The first step whenever you want to work on the documentation is to start Docusaurus, which will open your localy copy of the ARK Modding documentation in your browser and show you your changes in real time.

To this end simply run `yarn start` after opening a terminal window in the cloned repository folder as you learned in the [initial setup](../setup.md).

:::tip

If you accidentally close the browser preview (or it does not open) simply visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it again

## A note on text editors

As mentioned before we use [markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write our documentation. These are plain text files that can be edited with any text editor. Free and easy to use choices are:

- Notepad++
- Visual Studio Code
- Your system's pre-installed text editor (e.g. Notepad on Windows)

## Previewing your changes

You will notice that while you add/edit files as outlined in the next sections the browser window with the documentation will automatically update to show your changes whenever you save your files!
