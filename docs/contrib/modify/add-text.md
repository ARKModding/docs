# Adding text to a page

The best way to get started with your page is to look at a similar, existing page, and copy the structure and formatting from there.

From there you can simply type away!

Use https://www.markdownguide.org/ to learn how to format your text.   
Docusaurus adds additional features to markdown, which you can learn about here: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features   
There are further advanced features that go beyond simple markdown texts, if you think you need them view https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides   

:::tip
You can not only add text to your own page - you can also modify an existing page instead to improve it!
