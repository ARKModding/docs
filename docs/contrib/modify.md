# Add / Modify Content

You are now ready to add your own pages to the documentation, or edit existing ones.

## Start Docusaurus

The first step whenever you want to work on the documentation is to start Docusaurus, which will open your localy copy of the ARK Modding documentation in your browser and show you your changes in real time.

To this end simply run `yarn start` after opening a terminal window in the cloned repository folder as you learned in the [initial setup](./setup.md).
